Concerns: If we want to start launching our site to production , we need 
</li>
<ul>
<li>
actual approved domain. currently it is myprofile.creativechannel.com
</li>
<li>
need a logo or some sort of a branding for the site to distinguish it
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Also I've already spoken with Adam and Sam and I think it would be a good idea
  for me to go go to the bay for a couple of days to meet the new devs and see
    if they can also bring something to the table for our team here. Sam has
        mentioned that the devs are in office on tuesday.  So i was thinking a
        monday-tuesday or tuesday-wednesday remote work day.  I was thinking of
        going week of 4/16 if its cool.
