<h1 id="toc_1">NPD Meeting</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">General</h2>

<p>
The format of the meeting will change. we are re-structuring the groups for
better productivity. 
Starting next week we will start official sprints for 2 weeks (Mondays), where the NPD
will be held at the end of each sprint. The NPD meeting will be officiated by
Sam and mostly higher level discussions will take place. 
</p>

<p>
We will initiate weekly scrums where only the developers in charge of the
project or particular parts of the project will be involved (Tuesdays). This will allow the
scrum to stay tight and consise. Shahin will be running the scrums.
</p>

<p>
Finally, daily tech standups are help within the npd team to report on progress
and difficulties. Any further implementation discussions can break out into tech
talks if necessary.
