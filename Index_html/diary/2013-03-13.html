Looking at the design of the login page and the amount of work involved it
  looked like that the designed was meant to incorporate seamless communication
  (using ajax/php) to sign the user in. While this is possible the ammount of
  work required to do the pure front end development would substantially grow.
  Moreover, jquery modal boxes and overlays do not work well with mobile devices
  and if someone would approach our site from mobile, they would have difficulty
  signing in.
  The solution is to keep the design as responsive as possible and after talking
  to sam , we are going to simplify the design to be on the page as a responsive
  box for the first round and build upon it.
