* Trying to figure out the reserved words for closing tasks in rally using
  github messages. so far tried Complete, Fixed, Fixes and none have done the
  job. Have researched sites and havent found anything that talks about it .
  Will look more into it slowly.

* Implemented Security questions dropdown and front end jquery to remove
  previously selected security questions as the user fills out the form so that
  they dont select the same question over .
* Debugged some issues with API with danny. It seems that sometimes there are
  packet losses. At this point we dont know if its becasue mike may be working
  on the system or something is causing the issue.
* Still need to work a bit on the error validation based on API response to make
  the signup process a bit more user friendly.
* Danny and I have submitted helpdesk tickets to resolve aws issues.
