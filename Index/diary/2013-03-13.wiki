* Looking at the design of the login page and the amount of work involved it
  looked like that the designed was meant to incorporate seamless communication
  (using ajax/php) to sign the user in. While this is possible the ammount of
  work required to do the pure front end development would substantially grow.
  Moreover, jquery modal boxes and overlays do not work well with mobile devices
  and if someone would approach our site from mobile, they would have difficulty
  signing in.
  The solution is to keep the design as responsive as possible and after talking
  to sam , we are going to simplify the design to be on the page as a responsive
  box for the first round and build upon it.

* also talk to mike m about some confusion regarding vpc and what we wanted to
  accomplish. Looks like we are all on the same page now. And he is working on
  the configuration.

* Continuing to work ont he login user story and my goal is to finish it this
  week so next week can focus on forgot password part.

* We had a phone demo with premium incentives. Very basic functionality with
  basic pricing. They could work depending how far we want to take it.

* Working with Danny to fix some hosts on the vpc to have the machines
  communicate with each other more sufficiently.
