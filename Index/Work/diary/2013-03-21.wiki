* Finished the frontend and backend of forgot question and reset by email.
* working on reset password by security questions.
* Did a sample demo of the site i've built with the responsive theme and what i
  believe what the system would look like to sam, vida and hanoz so that they
  can see a visualized version of what i think it could look like.
* working with danny to debug some issues with the API requests.
* I've asked the team to update the rally system so that the hours reflect how
  much work has been done and is left.
