* worked with danny to finish the vpc. he did a great job on getting it up and
  running and the schema is pretty secure and solid.
  * gonna work on some unit tests.
  * FYI: based on discussion with Rob, if we are looking to finish and deliver
    our project by 5/30 and have it to be fully integrated with legacy system by
    6/15, we shoudlb aggressive with hiring php developer, dba for npd, sysadmin
    and ux dev.
