= EOD =
* Fixed some issues with the deployment in jenkins after talking to Stephen
* Finished front end username validation on the application
* Installed and configured the mail server on local and webserver to send mail
  to users who forgot their password

* Implemented new code on the zend application side to send mail to user when
  they create their account. This was basically a POC to make sure that the
  environment and code worked well together.

* Mike Moreno got the VPC up and running. We are able to create a private ami
  off our instance and create new instance in the VPC, since VPC does not allow
  existing instances to be migrated into it. With the creation of the new
  instance we can have private and public ips and associate them to our machine.
  To access all our private instances we need to be on the VPN.
  A small gotcha is that the VPC instances are refusing ssh connection. I
  contacted mike about it and I'm sure we can resolve it quickly.

* I will be out of office tomorrow but can be reach through email if anything is
  needed. I'll check in periodically as well when time allows.

* Taking of a bit early because i have a 6 pm flight to catch =)
