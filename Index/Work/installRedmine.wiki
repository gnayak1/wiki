 == Redmine github hook ==
 * https://github.com/koppen/redmine_github_hook/#readme
 * after any plugin install go to the redmine directory /var/www/redmine and
   run: compiles the plugin
 `rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production`
 * restart the server 
    `sudo service httpd restart`
 * http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins

 * after you have installed the github plugin and configured it correctly for
   the plugin to actually work you must give web permissions to the repository
   folder
   {{{sudo chown apache:apache /var/www/redmine/repo
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/redmine/repo/*}}}

 * You also have to give ssh access to the github hook. You can do this by
   creating ssh keys user /var/www/.ssh and give them the correct permissions
    - apache as user
    - read to the folder and files
    - copy the new public key to github for it to allow access
 * optionally you can just copy over existing ssh keys that are already assigned
   to github to the /var/www/.ssh folder and that should do the same. In our
   case we already have keys for cicreativechannel user in github that accesses
   our redmine server so we just copied the same keys to /var/www/.ssh and give
   them `chwon apache:apache` user rights
