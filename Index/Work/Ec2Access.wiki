= Allowing ec2 server access to users =
*Important* NEVER give out the .pem key to a user. only sysadmins should have
 access to them

 * Ask user to create a ssh-key
 `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"`
    - enter through all the defaults
* The ssh key should be in /home/{username}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
* User should send their id_rsa.pub key to the sysadmin
* sysadmin will then add their key to the authorized_keys files on the server
  located under ` ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
