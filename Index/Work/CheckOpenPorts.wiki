= Check and open ports in Centos =

If you want to open or close a port for a Linux firewall you have to edit the rules in the iptables configuration. By default iptables firewall stores its configuration at /etc/sysconfig/iptables file. You need to edit this file and add rules to open port.

Here are the steps to open the port XY using the default visual editor vi:

Open port XY

Open flle /etc/sysconfig/iptables:

`# vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables`

Append rule as follows:

`-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport XY -j ACCEPT`

 

Save and close the file. Restart iptables:

`# /etc/init.d/iptables restart`

Verify that port is open

Run following command:

`# netstat -tulpn | less`

Make sure iptables is allowing port connections:

`# iptables -L -n`


remember to open port listening
add `Listen {portnumber}` in
/etc/http/conf/http.conf

if in aws
turn on the port in the group security

restart apache and iptables

`sudo service iptables restart`
`sudo service httpd restart`
